### Changed
- Updated Review algorithm to use activity type percentages

- ReferenceDictionary table change: Changed 'audio' filed 0's to NULL's. Still need to find where this field is getting set to 0 instead of NULL. This causes the error: CONSTRAINT 'FK_reference_dictionary_files' FOREIGN KEY ('audio') REFERENCES 'files' ('id') ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE NO ACTION
- Changed CardType âverbâ to âwordâ for all âverbâ cards
