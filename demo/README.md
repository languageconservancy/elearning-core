# demo

Demo assets and database file for testing frontend lessons and exercises consistently and in a maintainable way.

## Usage

- These are to be used nominally in a local environment
- The `elearning_demo_db.sql` database file should be imported into `phpMyAdmin`
- The webroot directory should be copied to your `www/backend/` directory or wherever your local server is. For MAMP it's in `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/backend/`
